This multiplayer patch replaces the original crynetwork.dll with one that uses OpenSpy, a gamespy alternative.

Put the crynetwork.dll in your 'bin32' folder in the crysis root.
(eg: C:/program files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/crysis/bin32)

You can also use the crysis.exe included to play without the dvd on old disk versions of the game.



I have heard that AMD users were having problems running the game in x86, Ill post any fixes I find, but for now if its not working try it using the 64 bit executable.

There are already a few servers, and a growing community.

Enjoy!!
