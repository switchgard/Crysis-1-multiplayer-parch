This multiplayer patch replaces the original crynetwork.dll with one that uses OpenSpy, a gamespy alternative.

Put the crynetwork.dll in your 'bin32' folder in the crysis root.
(eg: C:/program files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/crysis/bin32)

You can also use the crysis.exe included to play without the dvd on old disk versions of the game.

If your game launches to a black screen, try deleting (or moving if you want to keep it) the crysis folder located in: 
C:/users/yourusername/Documents/My games/

also, to skip the startup videos (which take forever!) and fix some console problems, create a shortcut of crysis.exe and add this 
to the path: +con_restricted 0 +g_skipIntro 1 

>> newbs: right click, properties, shortcut tab, paste it after the quote.




I have heard that AMD users were having problems running the game in x86, Ill post any fixes I find, but for now if its not working 
try it using the 64 bit executable.

There are already a few servers, and a growing community.

Enjoy!!
